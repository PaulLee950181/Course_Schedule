# Course_Schedule

There are a total of N courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to N - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

The output is a sequence that represents the order we should take the course. If there is no solution, output "Conflict".
